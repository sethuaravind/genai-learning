# LangGraph
LangGraph is power library of Langchain that helps to create a flow for agentic AI to perform series of tasks.

There are 6 types of code module
1.	Code – Fully rely on human code
2.	LLM call – Using LLM for simple task like summarization
3.	Chain – One direction flow
4.	Router – eg RAG
5.	State Machine – Cycle based decision - Langgraph
6.	Autonomous – Fully autonomous – RGPT

Graph – Data Structure
State Machine – State Machine is computation model consists of states and transfer between those states that helps in sequence of computer tasks. 

Flow Engineering
- Flow Engineering is systematic approach for development that incorporate AI decision making. 
- AutoGPT and BabyAGI involves in developing the long term planning, they chunk the task and operate on it.
- Flow Engineering consists of planning and testing phase to develop the code like human.
- Developer write state, what is the flow and what needs to be done. LLM will decide which flow to take.
